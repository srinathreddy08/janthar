      "Purpose of the Document": "This document provides a comprehensive technical and functional overview of the EDBNAECE program, detailing its role within the NAS Evergreening system. It is intended to guide architects, developers, analysts, and new team members in understanding the program's business context, design, processing logic, inputs, outputs, and integration points.",
      "Program Overview": {
        "Business Context": "EDBNAECE operates within the NAS Evergreening environment, a system responsible for maintaining and updating subscriber data quality and processing statistics. It processes audit and DIN input files to aggregate counts of DINs, PINs, and LINs, updates statistical records, generates detailed display statistics, and conditionally creates reapply files for data correction workflows.",
